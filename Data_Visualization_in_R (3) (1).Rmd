This R markdown will give you a brief introduction to visualizing  data in R using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) libraries. 

 In this Notebook you will learn:

- Creating plots using ggplot2 
- Aesthetics to customize your plots
- Interactive plots with plotly 

Most of the notebooks, markdowns, and code  we are going to be using are inspired from existing material that is available online and are made free for educational purposes. Nonetheless, these should not be share without prior permission of the instructor. When working in an assignment always remember the [Student Code of Conduct](https://conduct.lafayette.edu/student-handbook/student-code-of-conduct/).

*This markdown was inspired and uses some of the code and text from the book:

- Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. " O'Reilly Media, Inc." [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#statistical-transformations)

**Instructions:**

- Only modify the code that is within the comments:

`### START CODE HERE ###`

`### END CODE HERE ###`

- You need to run all the code cells sequentially
- If you are asked to change/update a cell, change/update and run it to check if your result is correct.

# 1- ggplot2

Here we will learn how to visualise your data using ggplot2. R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf), a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.


```{r}
#This chapter focusses on ggplot2, one of the core members of the tidyverse. To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this chapter, load the tidyverse by running this code:

#1st we check if you have it already ot not, o/w we install it
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies=T)
#You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session.

#Now we load it
library(tidyverse)

```

If we need to be explicit about where a function (or dataset) comes from, we’ll use the special form package::function(). For example, ggplot2::ggplot() tells you explicitly that we’re using the ggplot() function from the ggplot2 package.

## 1.1- The `mpg` data frame 

Let’s use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?

You can test your answer with the mpg data frame found in ggplot2 (aka ggplot2::mpg). A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
dim(mpg)
### END CODE HERE ###
```

>How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
#Mpg has 234 rows and 11 columns 





Among the variables in `mpg` are:

1. `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

2. `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

To learn more about `mpg`, open its help page by running `?mpg` on the console.

> What does the drv variable describe? 

unique(mpg$drv)

#drv describes front wheel drive, 4 wheel drive and rear wheel drive 

## 1.2- Aesthetic 

To plot `mpg`, run this code to put displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis:

```{r}
#With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot(). ggplot() creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph. So ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.

ggplot(data = mpg) 
```

```{r}
#You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to ggplot(). The function geom_point() adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The mapping argument is always paired with aes(), and the x and y arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, mpg.
```

>What relationship shows this plot?

#As engine displacement (displ) increases, highway MPG (hwy) tends to decrease.
>Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?

#confirm hypothesis 
Let’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with ggplot2. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.


`ggplot(data = <DATA>) + <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))`


Now make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
### END CODE HERE ###


### END CODE HERE ###
```


Now make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`.

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
### END CODE HERE ###

### END CODE HERE ###
```


>What insights you gain from this plot?
#The plot shows that larger engine sizes generally correlate with lower highway fuel efficiency, with variations across different car classes.

In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(mpg, displ > 5, hwy > 20), colour = "red", size = 2.2)
```

Let's hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the `class` value for each car. The `class` variable of the `mpg` dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).

You can add a third variable, like `class`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an __aesthetic__. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word "value" to describe data, let's use the word "level" to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point's size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:



```{r, echo = FALSE, asp = 1/4}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(1, 1), size = 20) +
  geom_point(aes(2, 1), size = 10,shape = 21,colour = "blue") + 
  geom_point(aes(3, 1), size = 20, shape = 14) + 
  geom_point(aes(4, 1), size = 20, shape=20,colour = "blue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.5, 4.5), labels = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.9, 1.1), labels = NULL) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/3)

#try change the "shape" argument with a different number
```

```{r}
shapes <- tibble(
  shape = c(0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6:19, 22, 21, 24, 23, 20),
  x = (0:24 %/% 5) / 2,
  y = (-(0:24 %% 5)) / 4
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  expand_limits(x = 4.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL, limits = c(-1.2, 0.2)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/2.75)

#R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the colour and fill aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0–14) have a border determined by colour; the solid shapes (15–18) are filled with colour; the filled shapes (21–24) have a border of colour and are filled with fill. 
```

You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the `colors` of your points to the `class` variable to reveal the class of each car.Try it:

To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside `aes()`. ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as __scaling__. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.

```{r}

### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
### END CODE HERE ###


```


The colors reveal that many of the unusual points are two-seater cars. These cars don't seem like hybrids, and are, in fact, sports cars! Sports cars have large engines like SUVs and pickup trucks, but small bodies like midsize and compact cars, which improves their gas mileage. In hindsight, these cars were unlikely to be hybrids since they have large engines.

In the above example, we mapped `class` to the color aesthetic, but we could have mapped `class` to the size aesthetic in the same way. In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. Try it:

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
### END CODE HERE ###

```

We get a _warning_ here, because mapping an unordered variable (`class`) to an ordered aesthetic (`size`) is not a good idea.

Or we could have mapped class to the alpha aesthetic, which controls the transparency of the points: 

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
### END CODE HERE ###


```

Or to the shape aesthetic, which controls the shape of the points:

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
### END CODE HERE ###

```

What happened to the SUVs? ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.


For each aesthetic, you use aes() to associate the name of the aesthetic with a variable to display. The aes() function gathers together each of the aesthetic mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer’s mapping argument. The syntax highlights a useful insight about x and y: the x and y locations of a point are themselves aesthetics, visual properties that you can map to variables to display information about the data.

Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.

You can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

>What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
#The points are not blue because the color = "blue" argument is outside the aes() function, so it is not mapped to the data but instead overrides the default aesthetic mapping.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```



## 1.3- Facets


One way to add additional variables is with aesthetics. Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into __facets__, subplots that each display one subset of the data. 

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name (here "formula" is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for "equation"). The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call. The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a `~`. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

>What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot below?

#The empty cells in facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) indicate no data for certain combinations of drv and cyl.
```{r}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```


>What happens if you facet on a continuous variable? (explain and show code)

```{r}
### START CODE HERE ###
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ displ)
### END CODE HERE ###


```

# 2- Quick intro to Plotly

Plotly's R graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Plotly.R is free and open source and you can view the source, report issues or contribute on GitHub. 

```{r}

if (!require("plotly")) install.packages("plotly", dependencies=T)
library(plotly)

 plot_ly(data = mpg, x = ~displ, y = ~cty)

```

```{r}
plot_ly(data = mpg, x = ~displ, y = ~hwy, color = ~class)

```


If we would like to create other types of plots, we can change the parameter `type` . See `?plot_ly`

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mpg, y = ~hwy, color = ~class, type = "box")

```
